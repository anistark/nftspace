# NFT Space

A Demo NFT Marketplace.

*Note: This is for demo and learning purposes only. Do not rely on this code for production. Do not share your seed or private key anywhere in code.*

If you're not aware of what an NFT is, [read this article](https://blog.anirudha.dev/what-is-nft) to get started.

This was built during the livestream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/iotadev).

The smart contract was deployed using [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) on the [IOTA Smart Contract Testnet](https://wiki.iota.org/smart-contracts/guide/chains_and_nodes/testnet#endpoints).

The rest is simple web app. Just open the `index.html` and you're good to go. You do need [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) on the browser to run this.
Or you can checkout the [hosted version](https://anistark.github.io/nftspace/).

Contributions most welcome. üôè
